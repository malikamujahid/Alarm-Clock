# Alarm-Clock
This repository contains a simple alarm clock GUI application built using Python's Tkinter library. The alarm clock allows users to set a specific time for the alarm to trigger, and it plays a custom sound when the alarm time is reached.

To run the Alarm Clock application, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Tkinter library

PIL library (Python Imaging Library)

**Installation**

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/malikamujahid/Alarm-Clock.git

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

**Usage**

Run the 'alarm.py' script to launch the Alarm Clock GUI application:

python alarm.py

Set the desired alarm time using the provided options.

Click the "Activate" button to start the alarm.

When the set alarm time is reached, the selected sound will play.

To stop the alarm, click the "Deactivate" button.

You can customize the Alarm Clock to suit your preferences:
